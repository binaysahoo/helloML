Yes, you can submit the Mesos agent start command as a job to LSF (Load Sharing Facility) using `bsub`. LSF provides a mechanism to submit batch jobs, and you can use this to start a Mesos agent on a specific node. Below is a simplified example of how you might structure the submission of a Mesos agent start command using `bsub`:

1. **Create a Mesos Agent Start Script:**

   Create a script (e.g., `start_mesos_agent.sh`) that contains the command to start the Mesos agent. This script will be submitted as a job to LSF.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Mesos agent start command
   mesos-agent --master=<mesos-master-address> --work_dir=/path/to/mesos/agent/work/dir
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<mesos-master-address>` with the address of your Mesos master.

2. **Submit the Mesos Agent Start Script as a Job:**

   Use `bsub` to submit the script as a job to LSF.

   ```bash
   bsub -n 1 -W 24:00 -o mesos_agent_start.log -e mesos_agent_start.err ./start_mesos_agent.sh
   ```

   - `-n 1`: Requests one core for the job.
   - `-W 24:00`: Specifies a wall clock time of 24 hours. Adjust as needed.
   - `-o mesos_agent_start.log`: Redirects standard output to a log file.
   - `-e mesos_agent_start.err`: Redirects standard error to an error file.
   - `./start_mesos_agent.sh`: Specifies the script to be executed.

3. **Monitor the Job:**

   You can monitor the status of the submitted job using the `bjobs` command.

   ```bash
   bjobs
   ```

   This will show the status of all jobs in the LSF queue.

Note: The specific parameters used in the `bsub` command and the script content may need to be adjusted based on your environment, Mesos configuration, and job requirements. Ensure that the paths, configurations, and resource allocations are appropriate for your use case.

Keep in mind that LSF is primarily designed for workload management and job scheduling, and using it to start a Mesos agent might be suitable for specific scenarios. If you find that your use case requires more dynamic resource allocation and management, consider exploring Mesos features such as dynamic reservations or frameworks that can dynamically launch tasks based on resource availability.
