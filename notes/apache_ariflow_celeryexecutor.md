Sure, here's a simplified example of how you can configure Apache Airflow with the CeleryExecutor. This example assumes that you have a Celery cluster set up with a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) and workers running on separate machines.

```python
# File: airflow.cfg

# Configure Airflow to use the CeleryExecutor
executor = CeleryExecutor

# Configure the Celery broker URL (replace with your actual broker URL)
celery_broker_url = 'pyamqp://guest:guest@your-rabbitmq-server:5672//'

# Configure the Celery result backend (replace with your actual result backend)
celery_result_backend = 'db+postgresql://airflow:airflow@your-postgres-server/airflow'

# Other Airflow configurations...

```

Ensure that you replace the placeholder values with the actual connection details for your RabbitMQ server and PostgreSQL database.

Once you have configured Airflow to use CeleryExecutor, you can define your DAGs as usual. Here's a simple example:

```python
# File: my_dag.py

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

def my_python_function():
    # Your Python code here
    print("Hello from my Python function!")

# Define your DAG
dag = DAG(
    'my_celery_dag',
    default_args={
        'owner': 'your_username',
        'start_date': datetime(2022, 1, 1),
        'retries': 1,
        'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    },
    schedule_interval='@daily',  # Adjust the schedule interval as needed
)

# Define tasks using PythonOperator
task1 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='task1',
    python_callable=my_python_function,
    dag=dag,
)

task2 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='task2',
    python_callable=my_python_function,
    dag=dag,
)

# Set up task dependencies
task1 >> task2
```

In this example:

1. The `airflow.cfg` file is configured to use the CeleryExecutor and specifies the connection details for the Celery broker and result backend.

2. The `my_dag.py` file defines a simple DAG with two PythonOperator tasks.

3. When you run this DAG, the tasks will be executed by the Celery workers in the Celery cluster.

Remember to adjust the configurations and DAG structure based on your specific requirements and environment. Ensure that your Celery cluster is properly set up and running before attempting to execute Airflow tasks using the CeleryExecutor.
