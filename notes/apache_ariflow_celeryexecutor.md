Sure, here's a simplified example of how you can configure Apache Airflow with the CeleryExecutor. This example assumes that you have a Celery cluster set up with a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) and workers running on separate machines.

```python
# File: airflow.cfg

# Configure Airflow to use the CeleryExecutor
executor = CeleryExecutor

# Configure the Celery broker URL (replace with your actual broker URL)
celery_broker_url = 'pyamqp://guest:guest@your-rabbitmq-server:5672//'

# Configure the Celery result backend (replace with your actual result backend)
celery_result_backend = 'db+postgresql://airflow:airflow@your-postgres-server/airflow'

# Other Airflow configurations...

```

Ensure that you replace the placeholder values with the actual connection details for your RabbitMQ server and PostgreSQL database.

Once you have configured Airflow to use CeleryExecutor, you can define your DAGs as usual. Here's a simple example:

```python
# File: my_dag.py

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

def my_python_function():
    # Your Python code here
    print("Hello from my Python function!")

# Define your DAG
dag = DAG(
    'my_celery_dag',
    default_args={
        'owner': 'your_username',
        'start_date': datetime(2022, 1, 1),
        'retries': 1,
        'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    },
    schedule_interval='@daily',  # Adjust the schedule interval as needed
)

# Define tasks using PythonOperator
task1 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='task1',
    python_callable=my_python_function,
    dag=dag,
)

task2 = PythonOperator(
    task_id='task2',
    python_callable=my_python_function,
    dag=dag,
)

# Set up task dependencies
task1 >> task2
```

In this example:

1. The `airflow.cfg` file is configured to use the CeleryExecutor and specifies the connection details for the Celery broker and result backend.

2. The `my_dag.py` file defines a simple DAG with two PythonOperator tasks.

3. When you run this DAG, the tasks will be executed by the Celery workers in the Celery cluster.

Remember to adjust the configurations and DAG structure based on your specific requirements and environment. Ensure that your Celery cluster is properly set up and running before attempting to execute Airflow tasks using the CeleryExecutor.


The main difference between the `LocalExecutor` and `CeleryExecutor` in Apache Airflow lies in how they handle task execution and parallelism.

1. **LocalExecutor:**
   - The `LocalExecutor` runs tasks directly on the same machine where the Airflow scheduler is located.
   - Each task is executed as a separate process on the same machine, allowing for parallelism up to the number of available CPU cores on that machine.
   - It is suitable for small to medium-sized setups where the concurrency requirements can be met by a single machine.

   Example configuration in `airflow.cfg`:
   ```ini
   executor = LocalExecutor
   ```

2. **CeleryExecutor:**
   - The `CeleryExecutor` distributes task execution across a cluster of worker machines using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis) to facilitate communication between the Airflow scheduler and the workers.
   - Each worker machine can execute tasks independently, enabling horizontal scaling to handle a larger number of concurrent tasks.
   - It is suitable for larger setups where the workload requires distributing tasks across multiple machines.

   Example configuration in `airflow.cfg`:
   ```ini
   executor = CeleryExecutor
   celery_broker_url = 'pyamqp://guest:guest@your-rabbitmq-server:5672//'
   celery_result_backend = 'db+postgresql://airflow:airflow@your-postgres-server/airflow'
   ```

In summary:

- `LocalExecutor` is simpler to set up and suitable for smaller setups with lower concurrency requirements. It's a good choice for development, testing, or small production environments.

- `CeleryExecutor` is more complex to set up but provides scalability by distributing tasks across multiple worker machines. It's suitable for larger production environments with higher concurrency requirements.

When deciding between these executors, consider the size and requirements of your Airflow deployment, the number of tasks to be executed concurrently, and the available resources in your infrastructure. The choice often depends on the scalability needs and the infrastructure setup you have in place.
