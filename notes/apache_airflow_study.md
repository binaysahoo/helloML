What Is Apache Airflow?
Apache Airflow is an open source platform designed to simplify and streamline the process of orchestrating and managing complex data workflows. Originally developed to address Airbnb’s growing data infrastructure needs, Airflow became an open source project under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, which maintains it. The platform has become a go-to solution for data engineers, data scientists, and DevOps professionals to orchestrate and automate their data engineering pipelines.

Airflow’s framework for defining, scheduling, and executing workflows revolves around the concept of the directed acyclic graphs (DAG), a mechanism that allows for the clear, concise expression of dependencies and relationships between different tasks. DAGs enable much of Apache Airflow’s flexibility and extensibility, extending a rich set of features that enable users to create dynamic and scalable workflows tailored to their specific requirements.

Python For The Win
Because Python is the programming lingua franca of the data science world, Apache Airflow’s Python-based core contributes to its market dominance. The platform’s configuration and plug-in architecture, both written in Python, allow for easy integrations with a wide range of systems and services—databases, cloud platforms, and third-party tools, for example. This flexibility empowers users to build workflows that seamlessly integrate with their existing infrastructure and adapt to evolving business needs.

Airflow’s Approach To DAGs
The science behind DAGs is heavily steeped in graph theory, mathematics, and computer science, though the premise is fairly straightforward. A DAG is a graph that is both directed and acyclic—that is, actions and processes only move in one direction and cannot go backward.

For example, a group of tasks to be executed sequentially can each be represented as points connected by lines. The lines represent the order of execution precedence. Loops are not allowed, so you can’t go back to an already-executed task. Essentially, a DAG is a roadmap for getting tasks done without going back and redoing tasks once they are complete.

DAGs are the underlying mechanisms that power Apache Airflow’s robust scheduler, ensuring the reliable execution of tasks according to predefined dependencies and schedules. Airflow’s scheduler maintains a DAG of tasks, automatically determining the order of execution based on task dependencies and external triggers. This enables users to orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple tasks, parallel execution, and conditional branching with ease. With Airflow’s DAGs, users can represent the dependencies and relationships between tasks in a clear and intuitive manner.

Apache Airflow Pricing
As an open source project, Apache Airflow is free to download, use, and modify, making it an attractive option for organizations seeking a cost-effective solution for workflow orchestration and automation. But there’s an old saying that open source software is “free like kittens, not free like beer,” which means that while the software itself does not cost anything, the associated expenses and resource and infrastructure considerations to implement Apache Airflow can add up.

Ongoing Expenses
Organizations looking to host and manage their own Airflow implementations should budget for expenses associated with provisioning and maintaining the infrastructure required to run Airflow, including compute resources, storage, and networking. And depending on the scale and complexity of the workflows being orchestrated, these costs can vary significantly—especially for organizations operating in cloud environments where resource usage is billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Additional Expenses
Companies may also choose to invest in training and support services to help onboard their teams and ensure smooth adoption and operation of Apache Airflow. While there are ample resources available online—including documentation, tutorials, and community forums—organizations may opt to invest in formal training programs or consulting services to accelerate their learning curve and address specific use cases or challenges. These costs should be factored into the overall budget for deploying Apache Airflow within an organization.

Other costs may include integration-related expenditures—depending on the complexity of these integrations and the level of customization required, firms may need to allocate resources for development, testing, and maintenance to ensure seamless interoperability between Airflow and other components of their data infrastructure.
