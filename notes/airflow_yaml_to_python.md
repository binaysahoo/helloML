Converting a YAML or JSON configuration, which defines a set of stages with sequential and parallel steps, into Apache Airflow DAG Python scripts involves parsing the configuration and then dynamically creating the corresponding DAG and tasks. Below is a simplified example demonstrating how you might approach this using a Python script.

Let's assume you have a YAML configuration like the following:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: setup
    steps:
      - task1: echo "Setting up"
      - task2: echo "Doing something else in setup"

  - name: test
    steps:
      - task3: echo "Running test"
      - task4: echo "Another test"

  - name: cleanup
    steps:
      - task5: echo "Cleaning up"
```

And here's a Python script to dynamically create an Airflow DAG based on the provided configuration:

```python
import yaml
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator

def create_task(task_id, command, dag):
    return BashOperator(
        task_id=task_id,
        bash_command=command,
        dag=dag,
    )

def create_stage(stage_config, dag):
    stage_name = stage_config['name']
    stage_tasks = stage_config['steps']
    
    # Create a DummyOperator for the stage
    stage_start = DummyOperator(task_id=f'start_{stage_name}', dag=dag)
    stage_end = DummyOperator(task_id=f'end_{stage_name}', dag=dag)

    # Create tasks for each step
    for step in stage_tasks:
        step_id, command = list(step.items())[0]
        task = create_task(step_id, command, dag)
        stage_start >> task
        task >> stage_end
    
    return stage_start, stage_end

def main():
    with open('your_config.yaml', 'r') as stream:
        config = yaml.safe_load(stream)

    default_args = {
        'owner': 'your_username',
        'start_date': datetime(2022, 1, 1),
        'retries': 1,
        'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    }

    dag = DAG(
        'dynamic_dag_from_config',
        default_args=default_args,
        description='Dynamically created DAG from YAML config',
        schedule_interval=None,
    )

    previous_stage_end = None

    for stage_config in config['stages']:
        stage_start, stage_end = create_stage(stage_config, dag)

        # If there is a previous stage, set dependency
        if previous_stage_end:
            previous_stage_end >> stage_start

        previous_stage_end = stage_end

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        dag.cli()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script reads the YAML configuration, creates tasks for each step, and dynamically constructs a DAG with dependencies between the stages and steps. Note that this is a basic example, and you might need to customize it based on the specific requirements and complexity of your configuration.
