Certainly! Apache Airflow can be a great tool to help you orchestrate and automate the process you've described. Here's how you can leverage Apache Airflow for your use case:

1. **Define Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):**
   - Create an Airflow DAG to represent the workflow of your test cases. The DAG will consist of tasks that encapsulate the different steps in your workflow.

2. **MongoDB Operator:**
   - Use the MongoDB operator or a Python script with a MongoDB client to fetch information about the test cases from your MongoDB database. This task should retrieve details such as runtime, memory usage, dependencies, etc.

3. **Task Dependencies:**
   - Define task dependencies within your DAG to ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order. For example, you might have a task to fetch information from MongoDB, and subsequent tasks that use this information.

4. **Batching and Grouping:**
   - Write Python scripts or custom operators to analyze the information retrieved from MongoDB and create batches or groups of test cases based on runtime, memory usage, or other criteria.

5. **LSF Job Submission:**
   - Create tasks in your DAG to submit batches or groups of test cases to LSF using the BSUB command. You can use the `BashOperator` or write a custom operator for this purpose.

6. **Monitoring Job Progress:**
   - Implement tasks in your DAG to monitor the submitted jobs using BJOBS or any other LSF command. You can periodically check the status of running jobs and update the status accordingly.

7. **Logging and Progress Visualization:**
   - Use Airflow's logging features to capture detailed information about each step in your workflow. You can also create tasks to visualize the progress of running test cases, perhaps using charts or logs displayed in the Airflow UI.

8. **Scheduling and Execution:**
   - Set up Airflow to schedule the execution of your DAG at regular intervals. This ensures that your workflow runs automatically based on the schedule you define.

9. **Error Handling and Retry:**
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for tasks that interact with external systems, such as MongoDB or LSF. Airflow provides features for handling task failures and retries.

10. **Notification:**
    - Integrate task notification mechanisms, such as sending emails or messages, to notify stakeholders about the progress or completion of specific tasks or the entire workflow.

By leveraging Apache Airflow, you can create a structured and automated workflow that fetches information from MongoDB, processes and batches test cases, submits them to LSF, monitors their progress, and provides insights into the overall execution. The Airflow UI provides a centralized place to view the status, logs, and progress of your workflow.

Certainly! Creating a complete working code for your specific use case involves several components and may depend on your exact MongoDB schema, data structures, LSF job submission requirements, etc. However, I can provide you with a simplified example to give you a starting point. You'll need to adapt this example to your specific needs.

Here's a basic structure of an Apache Airflow DAG that demonstrates fetching information from MongoDB, grouping test cases, and submitting them to LSF. This example assumes a MongoDB collection named "testcases" with documents containing information about test cases.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Assume you have a function to fetch test cases from MongoDB
def fetch_test_cases():
    # Your MongoDB query logic here
    return [{"test_id": 1, "runtime": 30, "memory": 512}, {"test_id": 2, "runtime": 20, "memory": 256}]

# Assume you have a function to group test cases
def group_test_cases(**kwargs):
    ti = kwargs['ti']
    test_cases = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='fetch_test_cases')
    # Your grouping logic here
    grouped_test_cases = {"batch_1": test_cases[:2], "batch_2": test_cases[2:]}
    return grouped_test_cases

# Assume you have a function to submit batches to LSF
def submit_to_lsf(batch_id, **kwargs):
    # Your LSF submission logic here
    return f"bsub -J {batch_id} -n 1 'your_script.sh'"

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

dag = DAG(
    'test_cases_workflow',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='A simple DAG for test cases workflow',
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),  # Adjust this based on your requirements
)

# Task to fetch test cases from MongoDB
fetch_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='fetch_test_cases',
    python_callable=fetch_test_cases,
    dag=dag,
)

# Task to group test cases
group_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='group_test_cases',
    python_callable=group_test_cases,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)

# Task to submit batches to LSF
submit_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='submit_to_lsf',
    python_callable=submit_to_lsf,
    provide_context=True,
    dag=dag,
)

# Task to monitor LSF job status (replace with your actual monitoring logic)
monitor_task = BashOperator(
    task_id='monitor_lsf_jobs',
    bash_command="bjobs",
    dag=dag,
)

# Define task dependencies
fetch_task >> group_task >> submit_task >> monitor_task
```

This example demonstrates a simple Airflow DAG with tasks for fetching test cases from MongoDB, grouping them, submitting batches to LSF, and monitoring LSF jobs. You'll need to replace the placeholder functions (`fetch_test_cases`, `group_test_cases`, `submit_to_lsf`) with your actual logic. Adjust the DAG configuration and tasks based on your specific requirements and environment.

Ensure you have the necessary Airflow plugins, MongoDB libraries, and LSF command-line tools installed in your Airflow environment for this DAG to work. This example is a starting point, and you may need to adapt it according to your specific use case and environment.
