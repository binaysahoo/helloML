## apache messos

Extendable architecture via support for pluggable frameworks. The true power of Mesos as a platform comes with extendable architecture that allows additional features to be delivered via pluggable “frameworks.” Examples of features delivered by the pluggable framework include support for long-running services, batch scheduling, big data processing and data storage. Marathon is one such framework. Many frameworks already exist for common use cases, and it’s fairly easy to add a custom one if needed:
Aurora, Marathon, and Singularity for long-running tasks support,
Chronos, Jenkins, and JobServer for batch processing,
Hadoop, MPI, Spark, and Storm for big data processing,
ElasticSearch, Hypertable, MrRedis for data storage
