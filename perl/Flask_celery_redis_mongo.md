Celery and Redis are two separate technologies, but they often work together in a typical setup for distributed task processing. Let's explore their relationship:

1. **Celery:**
   - **Role:** Celery is an open-source distributed task queue system for Python applications.
   - **Functionality:** It allows you to execute tasks asynchronously and distribute them across multiple worker processes or even across different machines. Celery supports various message brokers (like Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.) to transmit messages between the main application and worker processes.

2. **Redis:**
   - **Role:** Redis is an in-memory data structure store, often used as a message broker in Celery setups.
   - **Functionality:** As a message broker, Redis stores and manages the messages sent between the Flask application (or any other application using Celery) and the Celery worker processes. It acts as a reliable intermediary, ensuring that tasks are communicated efficiently and reliably.

**Relationship:**
   - **Message Broker:** Celery requires a message broker to facilitate communication between the main application (e.g., Flask) and the worker processes. Redis is one of the popular choices for this role. Other options include RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and more.
   
   - **Task Queue:** Celery uses Redis as a task queue, where tasks are enqueued by the application and dequeued by the worker processes for execution.

In summary, Celery and Redis work together to create a distributed task processing system. Celery relies on Redis to manage the communication and coordination between the main application and the worker processes. Redis provides the necessary features for reliable message transmission, ensuring that tasks are executed asynchronously and efficiently.
