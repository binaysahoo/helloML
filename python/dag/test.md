Yes, there are Python libraries that you can use to visualize Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), such as those used in Apache Airflow pipelines. One popular library for this purpose is `graphviz`.

`graphviz` is a Python library that interfaces with the Graphviz graph visualization software. It allows you to create and visualize graphs and DAGs programmatically.

Here's how you can use `graphviz` to visualize an Apache Airflow DAG:

1. **Install graphviz**:
   First, you need to install the `graphviz` library. You can install it via pip:
   ```
   pip install graphviz
   ```

2. **Visualize the DAG**:
   You can generate a visualization of your Apache Airflow DAG directly within your Python script using `graphviz`. Here's an example of how you can generate and display the DAG visualization:

   ```python
   from graphviz import Digraph

   # Define DAG structure
   dag = {
       'build': ['test'],
       'test': ['deploy'],
       'deploy': [],
   }

   # Create a Digraph object
   dot = Digraph()

   # Add nodes to the graph
   for task, downstream_tasks in dag.items():
       dot.node(task)
       for downstream_task in downstream_tasks:
           dot.node(downstream_task)
           dot.edge(task, downstream_task)

   # Visualize the graph
   dot.render('dag', format='png', cleanup=True)
   ```

   In this example, we define a simple DAG structure similar to the one we defined earlier. We then use `graphviz` to create a `Digraph` object, add nodes to the graph corresponding to tasks in the DAG, and add edges between tasks to represent dependencies. Finally, we render and save the DAG visualization as a PNG image file (`dag.png`).

3. **View the DAG Diagram**:
   After running the script, you'll find the generated DAG visualization saved as a PNG image file (named `dag.png` in this example). You can view the DAG diagram using any image viewer.

This example demonstrates how you can use the `graphviz` library to visualize Apache Airflow DAGs directly within your Python script. You can customize and extend this example to visualize more complex DAGs as needed.
