BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained transformer-based language model developed by Google. It's designed to understand the context of words in a sentence bidirectionally, capturing both left and right context in all layers. BERT has been influential in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to its ability to generate contextualized word embeddings.

Here is a simplified example of using a BERT-based transformer for text classification using the `transformers` library in Python with the Hugging Face implementation:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from torch.nn.functional import softmax
import torch

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Input text
text = "Your input text goes here."

# Tokenize input text
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')

# Make prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(input_ids)[0]

# Apply softmax to get probabilities
probs = softmax(logits, dim=1).squeeze()

# Display probabilities for each class (assuming binary classification)
print(f"Probability of class 0: {probs[0]:.4f}")
print(f"Probability of class 1: {probs[1]:.4f}")
```

Make sure to install the required libraries first:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

This example demonstrates loading a pre-trained BERT model (`'bert-base-uncased'`), tokenizing input text, making a prediction, and obtaining probabilities for each class in a classification task.

Remember, BERT can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, etc., to leverage its powerful contextual understanding for more task-specific performance.
